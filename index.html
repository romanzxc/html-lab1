                    Carpathians are a range of mountains forming an arc
                    across Central and Eastern Europe. Roughly 1,500 km
                    (930 mi) long, it is the third-longest European mountain
                    range after the Urals at 2,500 km (1,600 mi) and the
                    Scandinavian Mountains at 1,700 km (1,100 mi). The range
                    stretches from the far eastern Czech Republic (3%) and 
                    Austria (1%) in the northwest through Slovakia (17%), 
                    Poland (10%), Hungary (4%), Ukraine (10%), Romania (50%)
                    to Serbia (5%) in the south.
